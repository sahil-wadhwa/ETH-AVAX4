Project: Degen Token (ERC-20): Unlocking the Future of Gaming

## Description

My task was to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.

## Getting Started



### Executing program

* Run the program on the Remix IDE.
* We obtained AVAX from the Core Faucet.
* Then take the address obtained on execution and then approve the transactions from the MetaMask Wallet.
* To cross verify and check the transactions paste the token address on Snowtrace and see the transactions.
